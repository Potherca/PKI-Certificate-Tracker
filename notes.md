# General development notes

The PKI-CT consists of two parts, the tools and the web UI.
The current idea is to develop the tools first as these will take up the bulk of the effort, to optionally create PHP API wrappers for these tools and to then create a web-based UI to approach these tools.

## Tools

    - What should the various tools be able to do?
    - Are such tools already available (for Debian)?
    - If not, which parts need to be build?
    - Which of these tools need to be wrapped in an PHP API? 
      (either for a deamon or to approach them from them web UI)
    
## UI
    - What should the UI be able to do?
    - How should the UI look?
    - How should the UI be secured?
