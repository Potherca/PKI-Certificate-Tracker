# Premise

The general idea is to have a set of tools that will enable an admin
to find and monitor PKI Certificates (either local or remote) that 
can notify the admin when certain scenarios occur in regards to a
specific (set of) certificates.

These tools should (ideally) be accessible from both the command line
as through a (secure) web-based UI.
